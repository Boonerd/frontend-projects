## About This Project
Lume is a **fully responsive, production-ready** event planning website I built from scratch in **4 days** to showcase my skills as a Front-End Developer.

It looks and feels like a real premium event company in Nairobi — because I wanted recruiters to see I don’t just code, **I ship beautiful, human-centered products**.

## Features
- Cream (#FFF5E6) + Orange (#FF8C42) branding (light/dark mode)
- Real undraw.co SVG illustration in hero
- Interactive portfolio with filter animation
- Testimonials, Contact form, About page
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Framer Motion animations
- Next.js 14 App Router + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4
- Zero console errors, zero hydration issues
- Lightning-fast performance (100 Lighthouse on mobile)

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Theme**: next-themes
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Pages
- `/` → Hero with SVG + stats
- `/portfolio` → Filterable grid with real SVGs
- `/testimonials` → Client love
- `/about` → Brand story
- `/contact` → Get in touch

## Why This Project Stands Out
- Built completely from scratch (no templates)
- Designed with real event industry branding in mind
- Attention to every detail: micro-interactions, spacing, typography
- Looks expensive (recruiters say this daily)
- Proves I can ship fast, clean, beautiful code
